"Tigase now operates using a Kernel and Beans style of programming. What "
"does this mean for Tigase and You? Good news, really. Tigase XMPP Server "
"is now working as a Kernel program, which will operate on itâ€™s own and "
"handle all the core functionality of the server. Component, and non-"
"essential functionality will now be loaded as Beans. As a user, your "
"experience will not change all that much. However, beans can be loaded "
"and unloaded without having to restart Tigase, meaning that the program "
"will behave more dynamically. This means a smaller footprint on memory on"
" resources when components are not needed, and longer uptimes without "
"having to rest art the program! This also allows for greater flexibility "
"for Tigase XMPP Server to be better customized for unique solutions."

msgid ""
"With the change of Tigase to a Kernel and Beans style of programming, we "
"have also changed how the configuration file is managed. Although you "
"will still edit the config.tdsl file like a plaintext file, a new style "
"of formatting will be used known as DSL. Domain Specific Language may add"
" more lines, but is a cleaner format, and provides a more secure "
"configuration design since validation of the configuration is done at the"
" domain level. For more information on this format and how to configure "
"Tigase, visit :xref:'DSL Configuration Guide'."
